    target="_blank" title="html5 specification">A paragraph</a> is a group of words put together to form a group that is usually longer than a sentence. Paragraphs are often made up of several sentences.

  <p style="margin-top:80px;">There are usually between three and eight sentences. Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by missing a line out, and then starting again. This makes it easier to see when one paragraph ends and another begins.</p>
